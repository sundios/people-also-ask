## Installation

To install and run this script, we need to install the requirements.txt and the driver. Since we are using Chrome, we need to download the latest Chrome driver.


### Requirements

To install requirements.txt, please run the following on the terminal.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Chrome driver

#### 1.- Step one (Check Chrome Version)

Check which Chrome version you are using.

you can do it via the terminal using the following command:

```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --version
```

or you can simply go into Chrome and click on Chrome> About Google Chrome. you should see something like:

```
Google Chrome is up to date.
Version 89.0.4389.90 (Official Build) (x86_64)
```

#### 2.- Step two (Download Chrome Driver)

Download the correct version of Chrome driver.

Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

And click on your chrome version.

E.g: 'Chrome version 89, please download ChromeDriver 89.0.4389.23'


#### 3.- Step three (Chrome driver permissions)

If you are on MacOS Catalina do the following:

Navigate to the path where your Chromedriver file is located and run 

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver

```

#### 4.- Step four (chromedriver path)

You can do either solution:

a.- Move chrome driver to /usr/local/bin/ 

Make sure you are on the folder chromedriver is and run.

```bash
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
```

b.- Update the chrome driver path on the Python script.

On line 35, update `executable_path` with your Chrome driver path

```python
executable_path='add_path_here'
```


## Usage
 
To run the script, we go to the terminal and ensure we are in the correct folder. We type:


```bash
python3 paa.py
```

Once you run the script it will ask you to provide 3 inputs that are necessary.

1. **Add Query:** Query that you want to get the answers from.

**E.g**

```
netflix stock
```

2. **How many questions do you want to click?:** The more clicks you add the more question you get. Usually, 1 click adds 2 or 3 questions and by default, Google provides 4 questions. So if we add 5 as clicks, then we would get around 15 questions.

3. **Please select your language:** I added only 2 languages, English (en) and Spanish (es). Make sure that the language is in lowercase.

## Result

Once you run the script, it will output a df with all the questions that found for the query you requested. The output should look like this:

**English E.g**
